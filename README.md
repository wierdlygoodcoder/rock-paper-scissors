# Rock Paper Scissers Lizard Spock
Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spoke is a game to see if you can win against a randomly generated choice that you will hope that you can win against.
I have had a lot of fun building this project after finally deciding that itâ€™s targeted any age. I hope this game has enough explanation to explain how to win and lose. 
users of the game will learn how to play Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock and how to win compared to the normal Rock, Paper and Scissors it has a double number of ways to win.
