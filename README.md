## Features

- **Title Bar**
  - Featured at the top of the age telling any user the name of the game.
  - The title bar has a black background and white. this color choice means there is a lot of contrast between the background and foreground.

   - This allows users to understand whether they lost won or drawn.
   - When the user wins the statement says paper smashes rock.
   - When the computer wins it says for example paper loses to Spock.

 ### Features Left to Implement
 
 One feature I would like to implement is so the score increments by 1 then the user tells who one with a modal and once they click ok the web page would reload.
 
 ## Testing
- I have tested that this page works in different browsers: Chrome, Edge, safari, and firefox
- I confirm that this project is responsive, and looks good on all standard screen sizes using the inspect function on google chrome.
- I tested to make sure that the text is readable in all areas of the webpage.
- I tested the form to make sure it outputs

 ### Bugs
 The bugs I found while coding this were fixed by just using the correct variables and spelling which is something that I struggle with and am working on the first bug took me around 10 mins to solve 
 
- The plan was to get the image that the user clicked to show up above 
- I had to find a way to do that but I went around the houses and could not find the right way 
- Till I thought about changing the source and then it was easier to fix
- I then had to put it in the right function which meant that I tried to put in many functions till I thought about 
- then I asked myself when doing the decisions get made that were in the game function and put it in there using the variables that were stated and it worked.
