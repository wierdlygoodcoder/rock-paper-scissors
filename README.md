 ### Features Left to Implement
 
 one feature i would like to implement is so the the score incriments by 1 then the user tell whos one with a modal and once they click ok the web page would reload.
 
 ## Testing
- I have tested that this page works in different browsers: Chrome, Edge, safari, and firefox
- I confirm that this project is responsive, looks good on all standard screen sizes using the inspect function on google chrome.
- I tested to make sure that the text is readable in all areas of the webpage.
- I tested the form to make sure it outputs

 ### Bugs
 the bugs the i found while coding this where fixed by just using the correct variables and spelling which is something that i struggle with and am working on the first bug took me around 10 mins to sove 
 
- the plan was to get the image that the user clicked to show up above 
- i had to find a way to do that but i went around the houses and could not find the right way 
- till i thought about changing the scource and then it was easier to fix
- i then had to put it in the right function witch meant that i tried to put in many functions till i thought about 
- then i asked myself when does the decisions get made that was in the game function and put it in there using the veriables the was stated and it worked.
